This repo contains python scripts that can simplify your work when dealing with face recognition projects!

## Python Scripts


**folders.py**: This script helps in retrieving the number of folders in your directories. You can store them in csv file by importing the csv module.\
**filter.py** : This script is especially useful when we want to manually filter the images by comparing it with the base image. It displays the base image of the identity along with the current image from the folder and the cropped image of the current image. The cropped image is displayed by taking the maximum bounding box of the image using a detection model.
